title: North Carolina Legal Hackers
---

North Carolina Legal Hackers started as two Meetup Groups. Legal Hackers in Charlotte and Hacking the Law in Raleigh. We have had numerous programs about Bitcoin, Smart Contracts, Computer Security.

We helped sponsor an Access to Law Hackathon together with the NC Bar Asociation and the ABA at Campbell University Law Schoool in Raleigh.
